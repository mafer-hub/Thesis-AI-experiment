# hello! this is an attempt at learning how to use python and runa  code to evaluate the sentiment
#everything that is written with a # is a comment, so python ignores them, but i-I can write here to explain

#now let's start!
#you can download python for free from its website
#i use sublime text to write code - there are many alternatives, so please choose whatever you prefer! sublime text is also free
#first thing to do: save the file with the .py extension (so something like name.py)
#to make it work you need to "run it", as in to say "go ahead and do what i told you to do": to do this after writing the code you need to press ctrl + b
#for example, if you write:

print ('hello world')

#print in python means "make this appear on the screen"
#if you then press ctrl + b, in the lower part of the page the sentence "hello world" should appear
#we can try again with something else, like

print ('thank you for reading this!')

#now this second sentence should appear too!
#now something a bit more complicated

first_name = 'name'
last_name = 'surname'
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
print(full_name)

#we told python to print the full name, so it did (the ' ' is the space between the name and surname)
